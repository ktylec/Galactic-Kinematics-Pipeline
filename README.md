# Galactic-Kinematics-Pipeline
Python ETL pipeline &amp; non-linear statistical modeling (SciPy) for the UHST v15 astrophysical framework. Evaluates 171 SPARC galaxies using rigorous out-of-sample validation (Stratified K-Fold &amp; Monte Carlo CV) to solve the missing mass problem. Demonstrates advanced data engineering, AI-assisted dev, and strict reproducibility.
